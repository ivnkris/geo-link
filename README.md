## Project Overview

In the midst of lockdown, our project Geo-link aims to connect and bring people of different backgrounds together based on their location and common interest. Hence, bringing normality back to our daily lives.

## Objectives

- Real-time event monitoring
- Allow user to save their favourite events for future
- Enhance user experience on the events happening at that venue.

## Getting started

We started the project with the following steps:

- We created a mockup image about the requirements.
- We started with HTML and CSS coding by using foundation CSS.
- Then we moved into JS coding and attaching the API's with the code.
- We checked the result at every moment with console.log.
- We verified the result and then completed the task.

## Project Charter

Geo link is a project which is build on an idea of connecting people in such tough times. The high-level planning included a documentation of the requirements and creating a mock-up of the website page and extended pages.

**Key requirement** - tasks, roles and responsibilities were allotted at the starting of the project. We used:

- Wire frames - Mock flow
- Mock ups - Adobe CS
- Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Zurb Foundation, Fontawesome
- Backend - Jquery, Foursquare API, Google places API, local storage

## User Journeys

- **Make a search** - User could use this webite easily on his mobile, tablet or computer and find a location according to his interest.
- **Meeting up single or multiple people** - user could click on the event and move to that event and enjoy by meeting up many people at once.

- **View more information about a single venue.** - Any user could click on "more information" button and view the details about that place like date, time, venue and event.

- **Add/remove your favorite venues** - User could easily remove an event or venue from favourite page by just clicking on "Remove Button".

- **View events within 50 miles of a venue** - This website helps to look at the events happening within 50 miles of range.

## Project Retrospective

**Work done**

- Geo link is a wonderful platform which helps people communicate and meetup easily.
- Geo link is a handy guide wrapped up in an interactive app which brings back multiple results with proper location, map and venue, for a single search.
- It depends on the interests and various activities which everyone used to do.

**Learning**

- It helped us understand the usage of various API's, foundation for CSS design, local storage.
- It also helped us understand the JS coding by using JQuery.

**Improvements to be made**

- This project could be improved by adding more details about the events that will be happening in near future.
- Also, we could add a reminder for every individual for the events which they have added to favourite.

**Lessons learnt** : We learned about various things:

- **Related to API** - We looked into influence of an API on the project as using Google maps API was a bit difficult.

- **Foursquare API** - It will be deprecated in a week and it lacked certain elements and it was difficult to use.

- **Ticket Master API** - This will also be deprecated and it was new to use.

- **Google Maps** - We got a problem to use google maps as GitHub pages doesn't recognize google map.

- **Sass application** - This was not recognised well, we need to implement it in other applications.
